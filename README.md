Initial idea: 

Arcade tank MMO pixel game. As the player traverse the map trying to stay alive, they are rewarded for defeating other players with increase stats, such as health and damage. As well as a cosmetic changes. 


Interface:

The player will control the tank with the use of the arrow or WASD keys as well as the mouse.

Map: 

All players will see the same things in real time, the map will scale to the size of players present in the lobby with the use of random generated blocks.

Customisation:

The player will have control over cosmetic choice such as colour etc. as well as ability to element damage.

Element damage:

The users will have the ability to pick what damage type there take uses. However this will work like a rock, paper, scissors system in which your type of damage will be super effective against certain other tanks but you will also be super vulnerable to one other damage type. 

Branches:
I created a new branch of git for myself where i will upload. We should all have our own ones, instead of all commiting to master. We will commit things we all agree to onto the master branch
